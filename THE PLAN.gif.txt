OKAY

okay

so

Here's what needs to happen.

First, let's get the CA working for sure. We want to test rule 90, rule 30, maybe a couple others. The interesting 
ones. One of us should check which are the Class-IV ones.

Then, we want to hook that up to a pathfinding thing. Set it up so that certain cell(s) control a movement head, 
which can MOVE in the direction its facing or TURN to the right. This isn't going to work very well at all, but
it will look fancy. 

Finally, we hook up the GA to the intial conditions for the CA. The GA keeps track of the CA seed (the dots which
are initially 1 or 0) and uses the taxicab distance from the target after a predefined number of moves as its heuristic. 
This will select for things that don't necessarily find the best path, but ones that get the closest to the target cell.
We can acknowledge this shortcoming in our paper. It will sound fancy. 
If the pathfinding head reaches the target within the move limit, that will also end it. Because the problem was solved.

I'm putting this here so that you can be somewhat autonomous while I'm gone over midwinter break. We need to get our
asses in gear.
